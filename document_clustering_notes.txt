From Cluster centers we will be able to infer the dominating term in that cluster

(16.8,14.0) is the cluster center for one of the clusters
(73.2,74.8) is the cluster center for another cluster

in the first cluster the centeroid of the T1 is 16.8 and centeroid of second term, T2 is 14.0. these centeroids are nothing but the airthmetic averages.
in other words 16.8 is the average of all the term frequencies across all documents  in cluster 1. Since 16.8 > 14.0 in cluster 1 we can conculde that cluster 1 s more about term1 than term-2. Similarly in cluster-2 T2 is more dominating than T1

Lets assume this documents here are mobile reviews,
 T1 is "battery" and T2 is Camera.
 cluster-1 is about reviews which talks more about battery and cluster-2 is about reviews which talks more about camera

Array of cluster centers
array([[73.2, 74.8],	
       [16.8, 14. ]])	
BOW = ['t1','t2']
num_clusters=2
Step:1. From the array of cluster centers - for each row sort the arguments in descending order, such that the index of the highest centeroid value appears first and least appeast last - ordered_centeroid_arg (use argsort and then sort the arg in descending order)

o/p after first step
array([[1, 0],	
       [0, 1]]	

Step:2. For every cluster
	1.subset the ordered_centeroid_arg to get the indexes of the  top(n) terms
	2. for every index :
		2.1 Subset the BOW to print the terms

Cluster : 0
t2
Cluster : 1
t1
Note: t1 is at index 0 and t2 is at index 1 in the input array of cluster centers
